# p5js-screenPosition

This function provides a solution to the missing screenX and screenY functions in p5.js. See https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/1553 for the discussion. 

**This is work in progress.** 

I'm aware of some missing stuff like tracking resetMatrix() and applyMatrix() in 2d-mode.

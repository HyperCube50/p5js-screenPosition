# p5js-screenPosition

This function provides a solution to the missing screenX and screenY functions in p5.js. See https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/1553 for the discussion. 

**This is work in progress.** 

As far as I could find out there should be anything implemented to make it work perfectly in any mode (2D, WEBGL, angleMode DEGREES or RADIANS, normal or instance mode). If you'll find a case that isn't working correctly, please file an issue.
